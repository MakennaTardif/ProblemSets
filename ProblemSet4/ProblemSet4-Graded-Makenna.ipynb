    "\n",
    "    loads = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n",

    "\n",
    "There are different models that describe the change in performance. One is a model that increases linearly up to a breakpoint (capacity limit), then stays flat.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a model with **two stages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Linear growth stage:**\\\n",
    "    Performance increases steadily as memory load increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Flat stage (capacity limit):**\\\n",
    "    After a certain point (the **breakpoint**), performance stops\n",
    "    increasing because the memory system has reached its limit.\\\n",
    "    The breakpoint is the **estimated capacity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if load ≤ k_break:\n",
    "        y = a * load + b    # K is increasing with load\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        y = a * k_break + b   # K stays constant\n",
    "\n",
    "The second model is an exponential model. This model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    y = A * (1 – exp(-B * load)) + C\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Fit both models to the data, where x is `load` and y is `k`. Report the relevant parameters for each model.  \n",
    "  2. Plot both fits on the same Figure and subplot (do not use two subplots) using `matplotlib`\n"
