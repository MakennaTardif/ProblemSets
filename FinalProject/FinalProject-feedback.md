# PSYC 5P02- Introduction to Programming for Psychology

### Fall 2025
### Final Project Evaluation


#### Overall grade: 92%

---
#### Coding style/Clarity:
* Code is clean and elegant. 
* I wonder whether, given the scope of the project, if it would be easier to navigate the code if you were to break separate functions into stand-alone scripts, and maybe separate different analyses/simulations into separate scripts/notebooks?
:memo: **check/check+** 

#### Coding efficiency:
* There is **a lot ** of lines of code, which makes me wonder if there is a way to make things more efficient, but nothing jumps out at me
:memo: **check+**

#### Documentation:
* A lot of documentation. Could have benefited from a readme file that describes how to interact with the scripts. Could have also used some help files in scripts. 
:memo: **check/check+**

#### Complexity, scale of tasks/analysis, and mastery:
* Attempted a difficult task and succeeded. Included a bunch of novel stuff (image re-sizing, the neat little sliders, the statistical analyses). Great work!
 :memo: **check+**

#### Completeness:
* No friction. Only critique is it would be easier to access as a stand-alone repository.
